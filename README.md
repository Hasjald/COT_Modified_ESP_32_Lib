# COT_Modified_ESP_32_Lib
Two new functions added, for GPS coordinates 

Use the writePOS() function to write just position to a signal, 
the old write() function is still there,
and anoter writeEX() function which lets the user write the position and value in the same request.

NEW: Using the V1 zip you can now send up to 8 decimal places to COT using writePOS and writeEX functions
